This applications is a small ruby application that provides a iCal calender with the most important pregnancy related milestones based on the due date of the pregnancy.

Start the docker container and the calender will be exposed on port 1234.

Request you personal calendar with the due date of your pregnancy in the following format:

http://<your-ip>:1234/<year>-<month>-<day>.ics

You can import this URL into your iPhone calendar as usual.

I'm not a doctor and these informations might be wrong ! I just converted the informations from
https://www.elterngeld.de/ based on their pregnancy calendar into a iPhone importable format for my own convinience. Please double check with you doctor.
